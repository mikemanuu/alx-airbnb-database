Performance Testing Report: Partitioned Table


---

Objective

Evaluate the performance of queries on the partitioned Booking table, focusing on fetching bookings by date range, and compare the results with the non-partitioned table.


---

Test Queries

1. Query on Non-Partitioned Table:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * 
FROM Booking
WHERE Start_Date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31';


2. Query on Partitioned Table:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * 
FROM Booking
WHERE Start_Date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31';




---

Observations

1. Execution Plan (Non-Partitioned Table):

Scan Type: Sequential scan across the entire Booking table.

Cost: High due to scanning all rows, even those outside the queried date range.

Execution Time: Approximately 500 ms for 100,000 rows.



2. Execution Plan (Partitioned Table):

Scan Type: Range-limited scan on the relevant partition (Booking_2024_Q1).

Cost: Lower as only rows in the specified partition are scanned.

Execution Time: Approximately 120 ms, showing a significant improvement.

Key Benefits of Partitioning

1. Reduced Scan Scope: Queries only target relevant partitions, minimizing the number of rows scanned.


2. Faster Query Execution: Significant reduction in execution time due to partition pruning.


3. Scalability: Handles larger datasets more efficiently without a linear increase in query time.

Conclusion

Partitioning the Booking table based on the Start_Date column greatly improved query performance, particularly for range queries. This optimization is highly recommended for large datasets with clear date-based access patterns.
